The proposed app aims to facilitate the training of swimming athletes by offering features to create personalized workouts and exercises, view statistics, and connect with other swimmers.

The app allows users to create their own training plans, adapting activities to their needs and skill levels. Users can select different types of exercises and track their progress over time, with the ability to visualize data such as daily activities and most practiced swimming styles and exercises, helping athletes to identify areas for improvement.

The development followed a Progressive Web App (PWA) approach, ensuring broad compatibility across various devices. The app is intended to be a valuable tool for athletes and enthusiasts, optimizing swimming workouts and promoting greater engagement among swimmers.
